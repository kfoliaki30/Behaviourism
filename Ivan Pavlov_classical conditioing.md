* Ivan Pavlov
* experience with his dog about behaviour
* He come up with the new concept called "classical conditioing"
  * he found "stimulus" which is the things or event that cause activity or energy in someone or something
  * In Pavlov experience he used a bell as a stimulus where he train the dog to feed everytime he rings the bell. The dog drolls when he see the food, when Pavlov ring bell with out the food the dog still drolls. He conclude that behaviour can be influence by a stimulus.
  * Pavlov believe that behviour can be incfluence by and unconditional stimulus (food) + sometihng neutral/stimulus (bell) + train then - unconditional stimuls (food) = dog drolling behaviour
