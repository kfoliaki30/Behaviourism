* John B Watson
* He believe that study of behaviour/psychology should be study as science (fact and measurements)
* He was inspired by Ivan Pavlov work
* He believe that human development are based on its surround and what he see/learn and that he can turn a child into what he want the child to be (e.g lawyer, electrician etc)
* Watson used the classical conditions by Pavlov, where he used a baby to fear rat as his experienment
* Watson brough rat (conditioning stimulus) and made loud noices (as his unconditional stimulus) which cause the baby to cry
* He then just brought the rat only and the baby would start crying. He conclude that baby behaviour toward the rat ad lound noises prove that he can influence a person
